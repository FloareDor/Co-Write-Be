**Co-Write**
CoWriter provides targeted AI assistance within professor-defined boundaries, making it a Canvas assistant application that helps students with assignments while maintaining originality.

**Features of Co-Write**

*For Professors:*
Create Assignments: Easily set up assignments with specific details like titles, descriptions, and document attachments.
Control AI Use: Define limitations for OpenAI access to ensure students stay on track and complete assignments independently.

*For Students:*
Targeted Assistance: Leverage CoWriter's RAG implementation to summarize PDFs and other resources, getting a head start on understanding assignments.
Smart Prompts: Utilize the built-in machine learning model to determine if your prompt needs general help or clarification, or if it's a direct request for answer generation (which may be restricted).
Adaptive OpenAI Integration: Access OpenAI's capabilities when professors provide resources, but with limitations to prevent plagiarism and encourage independent work.

*Future Plans:*
Use CoWriter seamlessly within the Canvas interface you're already familiar with.
