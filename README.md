# Co-Write

CoWriter provides targeted AI assistance within professor-defined boundaries, making it a Canvas assistant application that helps students with assignments while maintaining originality.

## Features of Co-Write

### For Professors:

- **Create Assignments:** Easily set up assignments with details like titles, descriptions, and document attachments for contextual AI assistance using RAGs and specific AI limitations.
- **Control AI Use:** Define limitations for OpenAI access to ensure students stay on track and complete assignments independently. We help preserve academic integrity and learning objectives.

### For Students:

- **Targeted Assistance:** Leverage CoWriter's RAG implementation for targeted AI assistance within professor defined boundaries getting a head start on understanding assignments. Be able to use AI on your test/essay guilt free.
- **Smart Prompts:** Utilize the built-in machine learning model to determine if your prompt needs general help or clarification, or if it's a direct request for answer generation (which may be restricted).
- **Adaptive OpenAI Integration:** Access OpenAI's capabilities when professors provide resources, but with limitations to prevent plagiarism and encourage independent work.

## Future Plans:

- Use CoWriter seamlessly within the Canvas interface you're already familiar with.

## Technologies:

- **Front-End:** Next.js, TypeScript
